# CompressionProgram
Independent Study - USF Spring 2020

This program implements a few compression algorithms in C++. These algorithms can take in arbitrary data and attempt to compress the file size. The user can choose an algorithm and file to compress/decompress through the program.


## Currently implemented compression algorithms:
Lempel-Ziv: Currently compresses arbitrary data.

Huffman Code: Currently compresses text files.

RLE: Currently compresses arbitrary data, though RLE will not often shrink a file size without other modifications prior. For example, a text file of a Shakespeare excerpt would not have many patterns. 
^This is planned to change by avoiding putting a '1' in front of single characters.

Quanitzation: BMP images can now be quantized.


## Currently implemented transformations:
BWT: Burrowsâ€“Wheeler Transformation of data, works in conjunction with RLE.

## Currently implemented encryption algorithms:
RSA encryption

Vigenere Cypher


### To Do: 
1. ~~RLE on BWT data.~~
2. Multiple character Huffman encoding (maybe to be combined with BWT).
3. RLE keeps single chars as is, only encodes necessary sequential characters.
